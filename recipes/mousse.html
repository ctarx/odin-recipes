    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      This keto chocolate mousse is perfect when a sweet craving hits. It's so
      quick it will be ready in no time.<br />
      No need to pre-whip the heavy cream — just throw everything into a bowl
      and mix!<br />
      Use any keto-friendly granular sweetener that measures like sugar. I
      prefer the powdered version of Swerve, since it dissolves better.<br />
      Adjust cocoa powder and sweetener amounts to suit your tastes. This is
      quite rich, so you don't need a lot to feel satisfied.

      <li>3 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>¼ cup powdered zero-calorie sweetener (such as Swerve)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and
        fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn mixer to low speed and slowly mix in heavy cream and vanilla. Mix
        in sweetener, cocoa powder and salt until well incorporated. <br />
        Turn mixer to high and mix until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes more.
      </li>
