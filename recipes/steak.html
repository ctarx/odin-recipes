        <p>
          This chuck steak cuts like a ribeye. Seared in a hot skillet, then
          rested while you prepare a quick and easy pan sauce, this steak is
          tender and delicious.<br />
          Serve it steakhouse-style, with roasted potatoes, asparagus, and
          sauteed mushrooms.

        <ul>
          <li>
            4 (8 ounce) beef chuck steaks, well trimmed, at room temperature
          </li>
          <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided, or more as needed</li>
          <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme (optional)</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
          <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
          <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Pat steaks dry with a paper towel. Season generously with salt and
            pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Place steaks in the hot
            skillet and immediately turn down the heat to medium-high. Cook for
            4 minutes.<br />
            Turn steaks, add 1 tablespoon butter (or more as desired) and thyme
            sprigs to the pan, and cook for an additional 4 to 6 minutes,
            depending on your taste.<br />
            Remove steaks from skillet and let rest, about 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, make pan sauce: remove skillet from heat. Quickly saute
            the garlic and shallot for 1 to 2 minutes in the skillet using
            residual heat.<br />
            Return the skillet to medium-low heat and add beef broth. Bring to a
            boil and reduce for 3 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove pan from heat and whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter.
            Serve sauce over steaks.
          </li>
        </ol>
